            <h2>Name and Info:</h2>
            <p> My name is Christopher and there is currently no beer in the residence Time to get more. </p>
            <p>This is my first HTML site. Get to know more about me as I explore the vast World of coding.</p>
            <p>I love football, Formula 1, Chess and video games(specifically fortnite)</p>
            <p>I am also keenly interested in farming since I see it as an infinite money glitch,
                 people will always need food and if you are a farmer you will be readily suited 
                 to supply and provide them with food in exchange for money.</p>
